Use the following context and preferences to generate YYY stock recommendations, divided into ZZZ % stable dividend-paying positions and AAA % volatile growth positions:

Context &amp; Holdings
- Available capital: SGD XXX  
- Existing portfolio: BBB  
- Geographic focus: US first, then China and Singapore  
- Sector focus: all tech sub-sectors (Software/SaaS, Semiconductors, AI/ML, Cloud, Cybersecurity, E-commerce/Fintech, Hardware) and a few extremely stable Singapore blue-chips  

User Preferences
- Timeframe: prioritize short-term trades for the more volatile stocks (weeks/months) but support long-term trades for the stable blue-chips and voltatile stocks with long-term growth prospects (years)
- Risk tolerance: comfortable with volatility if upside conviction is high, otherwise lean toward established names  
- Diversification: split capital across multiple positions (fractional shares are accepted)  
- Dividend vs Growth: ZZZ dividend-oriented, AAA growth-oriented  

Task
1. If any key information is unclear, ask concise follow-up questions before making recommendations.  
2. Research current market conditions and valuations thoroughly.
3. Recommend YYY stocks, specifying for each:
- Ticker and company name  
- Price (local currency) and suggested allocation amount  
- Position type: “Stable” or “Growth”  
- Brief rationale (including catalysts, valuation metrics, dividend yield if applicable)  
4. Provide two allocation views:
- Equal-weighted across all YYY positions  
- Percentage split aligning with ZZZ/AAA mix
5. Conclude with a one-paragraph summary of why this mix suits the user’s objectives.

Ensure clarity, brevity, and actionable insight.</code></pre></td>                    <td data-label="Remarks">Replace XXX with the amount of liquid capital in SGD and YYY with number of stock recommendations.<br><br>Replace ZZZ with the percentage of stable dividend positions and AAA with the percentage of volatile growth-oriented positions, where ZZZ + AAA = 100%<br><br>Replace BBB with existing positions <br><br><br><br><br><br><br></td>                    <td data-label="References">    </td>                    <td data-label="Tier">S</td>                    <td data-label="Purpose">Get personalised stock reccomendations</td>                </tr>            </tbody>        </table>    </main>    <footer>        Made by <a href="https://gabrielongzm.com" target="_blank">Gabriel Ong</a>.
